STATEMENT OF JOHN ROBERTS
Defence Statement pursuant to section 185, Criminal Procedure Act 2009

Date: 20 March 2024
Matter: Roberts v. DPP [2024] VIC MC 1234
Location: Melbourne Magistrates' Court

My name is John Roberts. I am 34 years old and reside at 45 High Street, Northcote, Victoria.

I make this statement in relation to the charge of exceeding prescribed concentration of alcohol allegedly committed on 10 March 2024.

EVENTS OF 10 MARCH 2024

On the evening of 10 March 2024, I attended a work function at The Colonial Hotel in Collingwood. I arrived at approximately 19:00 (7:00 PM). During the evening, I consumed two standard drinks - specifically, two pots of Carlton Draught beer. My first drink was at around 19:30, and my second was at approximately 20:15.

I left the venue at 21:45 (9:45 PM), more than one hour after my last alcoholic beverage. I felt completely sober and believed I was well under the legal limit. I had also consumed food - a full meal including a steak and vegetables - which I thought would help metabolize the alcohol.

I drove my silver Toyota Camry along Smith Street toward my home in Northcote. I was not driving erratically. I may have drifted slightly across the lane markings once when I checked my phone briefly, but I was not speeding and was in full control of my vehicle at all times.

At approximately 22:30 (not 22:45 as stated by police), I was pulled over by police. The officer who approached seemed to have already formed an opinion that I was intoxicated before speaking with me. When he asked if I had been drinking, I honestly stated that I had consumed two beers earlier in the evening, several hours prior.

ISSUES WITH PRELIMINARY BREATH TEST

The police officer conducted what he called a "preliminary breath test" at approximately 22:40 (not 22:52 as claimed). However, I have concerns about the proper performance of this test:

1. The officer did not clearly explain the device or its operation
2. I was not given adequate time to understand the procedure
3. The device appeared to be quite old and I question whether it was properly calibrated
4. The officer seemed rushed and did not follow proper protocols

I believe the preliminary breath test may not have been conducted in accordance with section 55E of the Road Safety Act 1986, which requires proper performance and maintenance of testing devices.

CONCERNS ABOUT EVIDENTIARY TEST

I was then taken to Melbourne East Police Station for what was described as an "evidentiary breath test." This test allegedly occurred at 23:20, though I recall it being closer to 23:00.

The result supposedly showed 0.08% blood alcohol concentration. However:

1. I only consumed two standard drinks over 4+ hours
2. I had eaten a substantial meal
3. More than 3 hours had passed since my first drink
4. I felt completely sober and in control

Based on standard alcohol metabolism rates, two standard drinks should have been fully metabolized by the time of the test. I question the accuracy and reliability of the testing equipment.

PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS CONCERNS

I was not adequately informed of my rights at the time of the stop. The officer seemed to have a predetermined view that I was guilty before any objective testing was conducted. This raises concerns about:

- Procedural fairness
- Natural justice
- The presumption of innocence
- Whether evidence was obtained improperly (Evidence Act 2008, section 138)

The officer's subjective belief that I "appeared nervous" and that he "could smell alcohol" are not objective grounds for forming a reasonable belief under section 49(1)(g).

DEFENCE POSITION

I intend to challenge:

1. The validity of the preliminary breath test under sections 55D and 55E
2. The reliability and accuracy of the evidentiary test results
3. Whether proper authority existed to conduct the tests
4. Whether the evidence was improperly obtained and should be excluded under section 138 of the Evidence Act 2008
5. Whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect (section 137, Evidence Act 2008)

The prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Given the procedural irregularities and the questionable reliability of the testing equipment, I submit that the prosecution cannot meet this burden.

I request full disclosure of all relevant material pursuant to section 187 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2009, including:
- Calibration records for both testing devices
- Training records for the officer who conducted the tests
- Maintenance logs for the equipment
- Video footage from the police vehicle and station (if available)
- Any other exculpatory evidence

This statement is made in good faith and represents my honest recollection of events. I am aware that providing false or misleading information in a defence statement may have legal consequences.
